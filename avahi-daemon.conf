[publish]
disable-publishing=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes", no record will be published by Avahi, not even address records for the local host.
# Avahi will be started in a querying-only mode.
# Use this is a security measure.
# This option defaults to "no"
disable-user-service-publishing=yes
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes", Avahi will still publish address records and suchlike but will not allow user applications to publish services.
# Use this is a security measure.
# This option defaults to "no"
add-service-cookie=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" an implicit TXT entry will be added to all locally registered services, containing a cookie value which is chosen randomly on daemon startup.
# This can be used to detect if two services on two different interfaces/protocols are actually identical.
# Defaults to "no".
publish-addresses=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will register mDNS address records for all local IP addresses.
# Unless you want to use avahi-daemon exclusively for browsing it's recommended to enable this.
# If you plan to register local services you need to enable this option.
# Defaults to "yes".
publish-hinfo=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will register an mDNS HINFO record on all interfaces which contains information about the local operating system and CPU, which might be useful for administrative purposes.
# This is recommended by the mDNS specification but not required.
# For the sake of privacy you might choose to disable this feature.
# Defaults to "yes."
publish-workstation=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will register a service of type "_workstation._tcp" on the local LAN.
# This might be useful for administrative purposes (i.e.
# browse for all PCs on the LAN), but is not required or recommended by any specification.
# Newer MacOS X releases register a service of this type.
# Defaults to "yes".
publish-domain=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will announce the locally used domain name (see above) for browsing by other hosts.
# Defaults to "yes".
# publish-dns-servers=
# Takes a comma seperated list of IP addresses for unicast DNS servers.
# You can use this to announce unicast DNS servers via mDNS.
# When used in conjunction with avahi-dnsconfd on the client side this allows DHCP-like configuration of unicast DNS servers.
publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will publish the unicast DNS servers specified in /etc/resolv.conf in addition to those specified with publish-dns-servers.
# Send avahi-daemon a SIGHUP to have it reload this file.
# Defaults to "no".
publish-aaaa-on-ipv4=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will publish an IPv6 AAAA record via IPv4, i.e.
# the local IPv6 addresses can be resolved using an IPv4 transport.
# Only useful when IPv4 is enabled with use-ipv4=true.
# Defaults to "yes".
publish-a-on-ipv6=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will publish an IPv4 A record via IPv6, i.e.
# the local IPv4 addresses can be resolved using an IPv6 transport.
# Only useful when IPv6 is enabled with use-ipv6=true.
# Defaults to "no".
[reflector]
enable-reflector=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will reflect incoming mDNS requests to all local network interfaces, effectively allowing clients to browse mDNS/DNS-SD services on all networks connected to the gateway.
# The gateway is somewhat intelligent and should work with all kinds of mDNS traffic, though some functionality is lost (specifically the unicast reply bit, which is used rarely anyway).
# Make sure to not run multiple reflectors between the same networks, this might cause them to play Ping Pong with mDNS packets.
# Defaults to "no".
reflect-ipv=no
# Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no").
# If set to "yes" and enable-reflector is enabled, avahi-daemon will forward mDNS traffic between IPv4 and IPv6, which is usually not recommended.
# Defaults to "no".
